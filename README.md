Ensure your program accurately and correctly solves the original requirements and specifications

- give careful thought to the UI and UX and improve if necessary.

If you did not originally consider these specifications, add them to your product:

- the cursor should start and remain in the input field

- ensure your program traps for all errors, including invalid symbols, negative values and zero

- after displaying an error message for invalid input, clear the input field and place the cursor there

- allow the [Enter] key to input the value along with the button

- ensure all forms have a good name displayed in the window’s title bar (and not the default)

- include a [Help], [About] and [Quit] menu

New requirements and specifications:

- the label now includes the following information:

            - the average shim weight

            - standard deviation of weights

            - the minimum shim weight

            - the maximum shim weight

- the app must deal with variable weight “runs;” in other words, the user will be able to set a weight limit for the bundle (eg, 7.5 pounds); the default value will be 5 pounds

- the bundle weight limit will be displayed and the app will also display how close the current bundle is to the limit (eg, x.x more pounds until the bundle is full).
